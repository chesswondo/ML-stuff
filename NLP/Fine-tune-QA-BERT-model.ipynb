        "# Question Answering with BERT and HuggingFace 🤗 (Fine-tuning)\n",
        "\n",
        "In the previous Hugging Face ungraded lab, you saw how to use the pipeline objects to use transformer models for NLP tasks. I showed you that the model didn't output the desired answers to a series of precise questions for a context related to the history of comic books.\n",
        "\n",
        "In this lab, you will fine-tune the model from that lab to give better answers for that type of context. To do that, you'll be using the [TyDi QA dataset](https://ai.google.com/research/tydiqa) but on a filtered version with only English examples. Additionally, you will use a lot of the tools that Hugging Face has to offer.\n",
        "\n",
        "You have to note that, in general, you will fine-tune general-purpose transformer models to work for specific tasks. However, fine-tuning a general-purpose model can take a lot of time. That's why you will be using the model from the question answering pipeline in this lab.\n",
        "\n",
        "First, let's install some packages that you will use during the lab."
